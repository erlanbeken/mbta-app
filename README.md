This is a simple React-Flask application that's supposed to use MBTA API but for the time being,
the backend is returning a hardcoded JSON to emulate the API.


Components:
 - Python Flask backend server
 - React frontend (create-react-app)


Prerequisites:
 - Docker


How to run:
 - Clone the GitHub repository
 - Execute "docker-compose up"
 - Observe the result at http://localhost:3000/
